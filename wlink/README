Worthalter Link
===============

This script was created to create a net of connection of Worthalter around the
year 2007. It has two methods, one is the old GD library to create an image
with a custom algorithm and the other is to use graphviz.

Database
--------

When I found it in 2013 there wasn't a schema file, so I recreated with the
insert in the code. The new schema directory contains a mysql workbench and
a sql file.

Deprecations
------------

It uses the old mysql extension, and in new systems a deprecation warning is
raised. Also, there are some pass-by-reference.
